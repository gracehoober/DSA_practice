# PRACTICE REPO FOR CODING SAMPLES, DSA, ETC.

- Personal repo for practicing DSA or creating a playground environment for small practice environments/ problems.
- Thanks to my mentor Nick Fuller for his support and advice to put all the code I write, no matter how small, on github.
Got to use to those green squares to show my progress!
